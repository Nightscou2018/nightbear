### Lessons learned

* Magnets are held in place by uncovered epoxy, which sticks together when the lid is closed for long periods
* The Droid power button cover doesn't close the gap fully (mostly aesthetic though)
* The screws for the hinge (on the Droid side) need to be shortened to just a few millimeters so that they don't protrude out of the inner wall (requires special tools)
* The hinges and/or its installation holes are really hard to place exactly right without any guides
* Besides the Droid power button cover, there's nothing to prevent movement on the non-hinge side of the case
* The cable should have more room to move vertically when the rig is half-open, at least towards the inside, but possibly also towards the outside
* The space unused by the Dexcom could be reclaimed on the outside of the rig
* The Dexcom slot needs to be at least 1 mm taller (along the longest axis of the device)
* The Dexcom slot bridge (that holds the top end of the device in place) needs to be raised maybe 1 mm so that it actually fits in
* The Dexcom USB port cover slide knob isn't perfectly aligned
* The thumb-slot for unplugging the cables needs to be wider, so that the cables are easier to operate (possible other improvements to cable operation would also be welcome)
* The Droid status led is obscured by the bridge that holds in it place
* Similarly, it's impossible to do the swipe-from-top Android gesture because of the bridge
* The screws on the inside of the Dexcom side are ugly :)
* Rounding on the outside should be increased where possible
